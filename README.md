# makeFile-steamplug, i dont know if steam plug has source control, i tried using it but it didnt work.
# You can clone this into your working directory and use some of the more usefull git commands like 
# generating ssh keys to allow to add origin to directory, push to repo, and to add origin to existing directory. 
# It also has a clean command to make sure the origin is cleared when moving directories with repos from folder to folder

# Just put in your correct credentials and add your ssh key to github are you are ready to go
# run make clean when moving a folder with remote git origin so it doest get confused when you try to push to github
# make repo only adds the origin meaning you still have to manually create the repo in github
# though i guess you can just make one and push everything to the same repo

# how secure is it you may ask? No fucking clue, um yea.
